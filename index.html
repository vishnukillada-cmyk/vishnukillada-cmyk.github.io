      <!-- Ingredients:

1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts

1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Salt and pepper to taste

2 tablespoons olive oil

8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 cups heavy cream

2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese

16 ounces fettuccine pasta

Optional: parsley for garnish

Instructions:

Cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

Season chicken breasts with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.

Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Cook the chicken for about 4-7 minutes on each side until golden and cooked through. Remove chicken and slice it.

In the same pan, melt the butter and add minced garlic. Cook garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Let it gently simmer for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly.

Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth.

Toss the cooked pasta in the Alfredo sauce until coated. Add sliced chicken on top and simmer for a couple more minutes to warm everything through.

Garnish with chopped parsley if desired and serve. -->
